# C

I started with C as that is the language that I know the best, and use all of the time. Not much to learn besides organizing Header files and including them.

# Java

I have a Computer Science class coming up, and we will be working with Java, so I decided to port my formulas over to it as a refresher. The main difference is that 
Java is an Object Oriented language, so I can utilize encapsulation. I made everything public except for the chart array for the 50/30/20 function. 

I had to reorganize the class containing the formulas into a package (which I learned is just Java's fancy name for a directory) so that the test program can access it 
correctly.

# HolyC

This one was pretty much C with a few differences, for example, the type "F64" is a 64 bit floating point, which is equivilent to C's "double" type. I did not create a
header file, as you can easily include the formulas in the shell and just run them. The file is not compressed, but that is not hard to change in TempleOS.
